//The first enumeration will represent the products a user can purchase and will store raw values that represent the display name of the software.
//
//The second enumeration will represent the edition of the software and will contain a mutating method.
//
//The final enumeration will represent the delivery methods available to the customer and will have associated values and a computed property.
//
//Weâ€™ll also be creating a few functions to complete the functionality of the store. One will iterate through the enumeration containing the various products a user can purchase. The other will send an order confirmation to the user based on the details of their order.
